Voluntour

## Purpose and Function

The Voluntour app was created to allow volunteers to keep track of their hours, as well as for volunteer organizations to track volunteers' hours for tax purposes. Volunteers can create an account and once logged in can check-in and check-out in real time, thus allowing accurate time tracking for whatever volunteer activities they signed up for with the organization.

Administrators (most likely executive directors) can register as administrators on the app, and then will have access to the volunteers' contact infromation for that particular organization, as well as the volunteers' hours. This will make it very easy for them to verify current volunteer hours, as well as aid in Request for Proposals (RFPs) for future grants for the organization.

## Languages / Frameworks Utilized

The Voluntour app is a full stack app using Node, Express, MySql, Sequelize, and javascript. Bootstrap, Sass, and Express-handlebars are utilized for the design and layout of the UI. Visual Studio Code was used as our IDE; combined with Chai, Mocha, Eslint, and Prettier. The app was then deployed to Heroku.
